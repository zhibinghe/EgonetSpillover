Version: 1.1.0
Author: Zhibing He, Laura Forastiere
Maintainer: Zhibing He <zhibingh@asu.edu>
Description: Using the ENRT dessign, we develop an estimator to assess heterogeneous spillover effects and a testing method, 
    the Multiple Comparison with Best (MCB), to identify subgroups whose treatment exhibits the largest spillover
    effect on their network members. Power and sample size calculations are provided to detect key influencers.
