# R package EgonetSpillover: Identifying Key Influencers using an Egocentric Network-based Randomized Trial (ENRT) Design

Using the Egocentric Network-based Randomized Trial (ENRT) dessign, the package provides estimate for  heterogeneous spillover effects, and further a testing method, the Multiple Comparison with Best (MCB), to identify the subgroups whose treatment exhibits the largest spillover effects on their network members. See "[Identifying Key Influencers using an Egocentric Network-based Randomized Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10170)" for details.
